# Mitigating the perturbation that PGD attack generates

Mitigation is done by the script 'mitigating_adversarial_with_7x7_estimation.sh' in this site.
Then, the result is copied to the directory of './data/migitated/'.
Especially, the epsilon of the examples shown here is the double of the maximum setting in the paper “Feature Denoising for Improving Adversarial Robustness” (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03411) 

## Requirements
* python==3.6   
* numpy==1.14.2   
* pytorch==1.0.1
